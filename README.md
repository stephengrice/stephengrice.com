About My Portfolio
==================

Hi, my name is Stephen Grice. I'm putting this portfolio together to sharpen my programming skills, showcase what I already know, and to have fun! I've done personal programming projects in the past, but most of what I put on here will be written from scratch to keep things neat.

My portfolio site, along with a resume, can be found [here](http://www.stephengrice.com/). It is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
