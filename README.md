About My Portfolio
==================

Hi, my name is Stephen Grice. I'm putting this portfolio together to sharpen my programming skills, showcase what I already know, and to have fun.

The site, including a resume, portfolio, and social media links, can be found [here](http://www.stephengrice.com/). It is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

The site was designed as much "from scratch" as I could manage, meaning: No Bootstrap!
