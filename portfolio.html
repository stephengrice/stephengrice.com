                    <p>Built during the inaugural Stockhack 2017 hackathon at Stockton University, ParroTweeter is a web application made for use as a marketing tool for a business of any size. The primary feature is the ability to enter a tweet in English, and have the tweet automatically reposted in the users' choice of foreign languages in order to reach an international audience. The project was developed in 24 hours in a team of 3.</p>

                    <p>This project allows you to generate a public/private keypair for the RSA algorithm, as well as encrypt and decrypt messages. It was originally a homework assignment for my Cryptography &amp; Data Security course at Stockton University.</p>

                    <p>The Playfair cipher is a classical substition cipher, historically encrypted or decrypted by hand with a 5x5 grid. In this project, you can use a command line interface to encrypt or decrypt messages using the Playfair cipher. Like the RSA project, this was originally an assignment for my Cryptography &amp; Data Security course at Stockton University.</p>

                    <p>Synth-me is a concatenative text-to-speech engine implemented in Python. I started the project because I was intrigued by text-to-speech software and wanted to learn more about how it worked. After a little research, I was able to focus on the problem of <i>concatenative</i> text-to-speech, which was basically the process of cutting and pasting short bits of audio to form a recognizable speech output. I broke the problem into three steps and created a working solution. For more details, view the source.</p>

                    <p>Racket Snake is a simple snake game written in the functional programming language Racket. This project doesn't exactly break any new ground, but for me it was really useful to apply a functional programming language to something as straightforward as a classic grid-based game. The exercise really forced me to dive in and figure out how to solve problems in a new way.</p>
